# Adaptive Sliding Mode Control Based on Neural Networks for Quadrotor UAV Position Control

## Overview
This report presents the design and implementation of an adaptive sliding mode control (SMC) strategy based on neural networks for the position control of a quadrotor UAV. The SMC controller is known for its robustness in controlling nonlinear systems under uncertainties and disturbances. The adaptive component, utilizing neural networks, further enhances the controller's performance by adjusting its parameters online.
